# Video Player
## Project #45 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This is a basic, responsive video player created with ReactJS. The aim is to link three components (App, Video, and Menu) so that the video player functions properly. App passes down this.state.src to Video, which uses this information to display the chosen video. App also passes down the ability to change this.state.src to Menu, which uses this to let a user select a new video.
## What I Learned
  - Programming patterns for mixing components with and without state
  - Using e.target.value to find the value of a DOM elements
